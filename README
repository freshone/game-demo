Attack of the Orbs 




As you regain consciousness you realize you are trapped inside
four solid brick walls.  Windy sky above, mossy padding below,
your weightlessness reveals this cannot be Earth.  Then...

IT BEGINS!



A furry of menacing orbs descends upon your sanctuary.  This
attack is relentless and, apparently, pseudorandom.  Armed
only with your steely jetpack abilities and trusty blue
flashlight, you must crush the encroaching spherical menace.
All of existence depends on it...

Good luck soldier!
